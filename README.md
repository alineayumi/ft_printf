# ft_printf

This project is pretty straight forward. You will recode printf. Hopefully you
will be able to reuse it in future project without the fear of being flagged as a cheater.
You will mainly learn how to use variadic arguments.

## Mandatory part
- Prototype: `int ft_printf(const char *, ...);`
- Format specifiers: cspdiuxX%
- Flags: -0.* and minimum field width with all conversions

## How to compile
```
make
make clean
gcc main.c libftprintf.a
```
